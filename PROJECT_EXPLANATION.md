# üéØ Credit Limit Assignment System - Clear Explanation

## What This Project Does

This is a **Dynamic Credit Limit Assignment System** designed for **banks and financial institutions** in India to automatically decide **how much credit to give to customers**.

### Simple Analogy:
Imagine you're a bank manager. Every day, you need to decide:
- "Should I give this customer a ‚Çπ50,000 credit limit or ‚Çπ1,00,000?"
- "Is this customer likely to pay back or default?"
- "How much credit is safe in an economic slowdown?"

This system uses **Machine Learning (AI)** to help you make these decisions **automatically**.
